/**
 * Flyway test extension for unit testing.</p>
 *
 * Description how to use Flyway anotation see javadoc
 * of {@link com.googlecode.flyway.test.annotation.FlywayTest}</p>
 *
 * <b>Notes:</b>
 * <ul><li>I suggest to use spring framework version &gt;= 3.x,
 * for better test support and usage of context access. </BR>
 * If you must use spring 2.5.6 see the following hints.</li>
 * <li>If you using spring framework version lower than 3.x the
 * annotation {@link FlywayTest} wont work at class level.</li>
 * <li>For spring framework version 2.5.6 use simple_applicationContext_spring256.xml
 * as application context example</li>
 * <li>If you using the annotation
 * {@link FlywayTest} more than one time in test classes than <b>do not</b> use
 * parallel execution in surefire plugin.</BR>
 * With this option you will setup
 * your database in more than one thread parallel!</li>
 * </ul>
